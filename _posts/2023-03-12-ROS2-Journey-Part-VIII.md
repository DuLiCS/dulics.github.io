# ROS2 Journey VIII



## 1. Prerequisite

```
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
```



colcon does out of source builds. By default it will create the following directories as peers of the `src` directory:

- The `build` directory will be where intermediate files are stored. For each package a subfolder will be created in which e.g. CMake is being invoked.
- The `install` directory is where each package will be installed to. By default each package will be installed into a separate subdirectory.
- The `log` directory contains various logging information about each colcon invocation.

#### Create a workspace

```
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws
git clone https://github.com/ros2/examples src/examples -b humble

```

In the root of the workspace, run `colcon build`. Since build types such as `ament_cmake` do not support the concept of the `devel`space and require the package to be installed, colcon supports the option `--symlink-install`. This allows the installed files to be changed by changing the files in the `source` space (e.g. Python files or other not compiled resourced) for faster iteration.

```
colcon build --symlink-install
```

```
colcon test
```

```
. install/setup.bash
```

```
ros2 run examples_rclcpp_minimal_subscriber subscriber_member_function
```

```
ros2 run examples_rclcpp_minimal_publisher publisher_member_function
```

The command `colcon` [supports command completion](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/installation.html#enable-completion) for bash and bash-like shells if the `colcon-argcomplete` package is installed.

```
echo "source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```
